                <p dir="auto">infoflow is an experimental framework for <strong>opaque
                        binary optimization via dynamic analysis</strong>.</p>
                <p dir="auto">by observing the behavior of a program at runtime
                    at the architectural level, we can <strong>fully analyze its
                        computation graph</strong> and provide a suite of
                    optimizations and introspection.</p>
                <p dir="auto">infoflow's flagship algorithm is <strong>InfoFlow
                        IFT</strong>, which traces the flow of abstract
                    information through a program to fully describe how any
                    value in the cpu registers or memory was computed, with its
                    value history and dependency graph. this dependency graph
                    also allows us to optimize how the value is computed on the
                    architectural level.</p>
                <p dir="auto">infoflow is designed to be as <strong>architecture-agnostic</strong>
                    as possible, to maximize where it can be applied. this is
                    accomplished with flexible abstractions to avoid duplicating
                    logic but also retain the ability to make specializations to
                    a particular architecture when needed.</p>
